This project was based on machine learning using Pyspark in google colab as the main basis for our models. We used a data set that had a biased amount of results, so an unbiased varient was implemented to give our data more generalised results. The goal we were trying to achieve was to train and test for fraud detection in transactions used with digital payments.
